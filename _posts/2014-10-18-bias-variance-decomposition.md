 ### Bias and Variance
  In statistics and machine learning, the bias and variance are two sources of errors.
  ####  **bias**: the error due to bias are taken as the difference between our prediction value of our model and the correct value. you can understand that bias measures the accuracy of our predictor for predicting the new input data .
  ####  **variance**: the error due to variance are taken as variability of a model prediction for given a data set point.
